# Apex Dream

**v0.1**

Apex Dream aims to accurately predict the aerodynamic properties and flightpaths of advanced model spacecraft equipped with intricate components like thrust vector control fillin up the gap amongst exisiting and publicly available simulators. Future version of Apex Dream introduce two-dimensional CFD simulations for generic non-compressible fluids and 3D flight simulation.
