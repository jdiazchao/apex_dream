# Apex Dream

**v0.1**

Apex Dream aims to accurately predict the aerodynamic properties and flightpaths of advanced model spacecraft equipped with intricate components like thrust vector control fillin up the gap amongst exisiting and publicly available simulators. Future version of Apex Dream introduce two-dimensional CFD simulations for generic non-compressible fluids and 3D flight simulation.

### Introduction

Model rocketry is an excellent approach to the intricacies and applications of physics that spark curiosity and entertainment. It concerns insightful investigation, extensive experimentation and creative design to maximize reliability, a key factor within rocket science. Therefore, simulation software is frequently utilized to predict the flightpath of a rocket to minimize risks. 

My interest in this topic originates from the development of an advanced model rocket, Apex Beta, I have been working on for over a year already, which uses thrust vector to control its attitude, along with a set of complex systems including a reaction wheel, avionics and a recovery system. An adventurous project I embarked on inspired by my keen enthusiasm towards engineering and space and the recent outstanding developments in aerospace technologies. However, no available simulation software is compatible with such complex systems featured in advanced model rocketry, which sets a perfect opportunity to deeply understand the physics of rockets and contribute to the community by developing simulation software for advanced model rockets, namely Apex Dream.

Therefore, this work aims to explore the extent to which different forces influence the flightpath of a rocket, accounting for thrust, weight and even aerodynamic forces, and more importantly, how to estimate them. This sets a fun physics challenges due to the lack of documentation on the chaotic nature of aerodynamics. Hence the research question:

_How may the flightpath of a thrust vectored controlled model rocket be predicted through the consideration of thrust, weight and the aerodynamic forces acting on it?_ 

The development of flight simulation software requires a detailed understanding of aerodynamics and reliable estimates. Therefore, the forces acting on a rocket will be first discuss at a theoretical level, and later estimated with empirical formulae, retrieved from experimental data and theoretical approaches. Finally, flight simulations will be compared to experimental data to verify the reliability of the product. Extensive research has been made within this topic; however, there is no defined mathematical model that describe the complex nature of aerodynamics. Thus, different models were selected and combined based on their reliability and similarity to experimental data.
